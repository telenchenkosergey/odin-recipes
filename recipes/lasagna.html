    <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>&frac14; cup butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>&frac12; large onion, diced</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>

    <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh spinach, rinsed</li>
    <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>Mix heavy cream, cream of mushroom soup, Parmesan cheese, and butter in a saucepan over low heat; simmer, stirring frequently, until well blended.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in olive oil until tender, then add garlic and mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Mix in chicken, and cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Lightly coat the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with enough of the cream sauce mixture to coat.</li>
    <li>Layer with 1/3 of the lasagna noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta, 1/2 of the spinach.</li>
    <li>Add 1/2 the chicken mixture, and 1 cup mozzarella. Top with 1/3 the cream sauce mixture, and repeat the layers.</li>
    <li>Place the remaining noodles on top, and spread with remaining sauce.</li>
    <li>Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until brown and bubbly. Top with the remaining mozzarella, and continue baking until cheese is melted and lightly browned.</li>
